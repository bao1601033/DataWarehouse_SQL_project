Data Catalog – Gold Layer
Overview

The Gold Layer represents the business-ready data model of the data warehouse.
It is designed to support analytics, reporting, and decision-making by providing clean, consistent, and well-structured datasets.

This layer follows a star schema design, consisting of:
